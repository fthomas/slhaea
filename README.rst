SLHAea - containers for SUSY Les Houches Accord input/output
============================================================

Introduction
------------

SLHAea is an easy to use C++ library for input, output, and
manipulation of data in the `SUSY Les Houches Accord`_ (SLHA). It is
based on the concept that a SLHA structure is a container of blocks,
which are then again containers of lines, which are then again
containers of strings.

Its main features are:

- fast reading and writing of SLHA files
- easy access to individual blocks, lines, and fields
- three containers (``Coll``, ``Block``, and ``Line``) that mimic the
  containers of the C++ Standard Library and therefore offer great
  flexibility
- the exact formatting of lines is preserved
- everything is stored as strings, so data is not restricted to floats
  or integers
- no precision is lost in read/write cycles of unmodified data
- blocks and lines are not restricted to the ones specified in the
  `SLHA`_, `SLHA2`_, and `FLHA`_ or later accords that use the same
  syntax
- easy to use since SLHAea is a header-only library consisting of only
  one file

Documentation
-------------

The API documentation is `here`_. It includes some `practical
examples`_ which can also be found in the `doc/examples/`_ directory
in SLHAea's source tree. There is also the `manual`_ (which is still
work in progress).

Dependencies
------------

To use SLHAea only the C++ Standard Library and some headers from the
`Boost C++ Libraries`_ are required.
